# AES_picEncrypt (AES Encryption/Decryption App)

> Deployement : https://shashank-kulkarni9.github.io/AES_picEncrypt/

## Overview

The AES Encryption/Decryption App allows users to encrypt and decrypt image files using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. It provides a simple interface where users can select an image file, enter a key for encryption/decryption, and perform the desired operation. The encryption process uses the AES algorithm in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, while decryption reverses the encryption process to recover the original image file.

## Features

- Encryption of image files using AES algorithm
- Decryption of encrypted image files
- User-friendly interface for selecting files and entering encryption/decryption key
- File download for the encrypted/decrypted image files

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- CryptoJS: A JavaScript library for cryptographic operations
- file-saver: A library for saving files in the browser

## Getting Started
